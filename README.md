# SocialMedia

Layton Emerson Individual Project

### Problem Statement

Movies, Games, Books and all forms of media are expensive. Have you ever walked through Best Buy and stared at the new release movie for $29.99 but ultimately decided not to buy it?

Social Media will solve this by harnessing the borrowring power of your friends media inventory. Using this site, you will be able to see if any of your friends own that game or movie you want to buy and ask them to borrow it instead of buying it.

Each user will keep their own inventory up to date which all of their friends will be able to browse and intiate a borrow request.
